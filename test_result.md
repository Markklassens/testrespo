Minor issue: Add Tool modal had timeout issues during testing but button is functional. Database connectivity was fixed by installing PostgreSQL and running seed data."

    message: "Completed comprehensive backend testing for MarketMindAI. Found several issues that need to be fixed: 1) Authentication errors return 403 instead of 401 status codes, 2) Category update endpoint doesn't accept partial updates, 3) Tools comparison endpoint has issues with form data processing. All other endpoints are working correctly."

    message: "Completed testing of Super Admin endpoints in MarketMindAI. Found two issues: 1) The CSV sample file download endpoint returns the wrong Content-Type header ('text/csv; charset=utf-8' instead of 'text/csv'), 2) The tools comparison functionality is still failing with a 422 error. All other Super Admin endpoints are working correctly, including user management, reviews management, advanced analytics, role management, and SEO management."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Fixed the tools comparison test by properly sending JSON data instead of form data. The endpoint is now working correctly. The only remaining issue is with the CSV sample file download endpoint, which returns the wrong Content-Type header ('text/csv; charset=utf-8' instead of 'text/csv'). This is a minor issue that doesn't affect functionality but should be fixed for standards compliance."

The API responds quickly even with large datasets (100 tools per page). The CSV sample file download issue has been resolved - it now returns the correct Content-Type header."

Key findings: 1) BACKEND CONNECTIVITY FIXED: Initially found 502 errors due to PostgreSQL not running. Successfully installed PostgreSQL, created database, tables, and seed data. Backend now responds correctly. 2) BLOG PAGE ACCESS: Admin login works perfectly (admin@marketmindai.com/admin123), blogs page loads correctly, 'Write a Blog' button is present and functional. 3) BLOG MODAL: Create blog modal opens successfully with all form elements visible. 4) RICH CONTENT FEATURES WORK: All three rich content buttons (Add Image, Add Video, Code Block) are present and functional - they open their respective modals correctly. 5) FORM FUNCTIONALITY: Title field, category selection, draft/publish options, and save buttons all work properly. 6) CRITICAL ISSUE - RICH TEXT EDITOR TYPING: The ReactQuill editor has severe typing issues - users can only type single characters before the cursor resets, making content creation nearly impossible. Console shows ReactQuill warnings about deprecated findDOMNode and addRange() issues. 7) The core blog creation workflow is blocked by the typing issue in the Rich Text Editor, confirming the user reports about being unable to type in the blog editor."

All CRUD operations working correctly. 3) BLOG CREATION API: ✅ WORKING - Blog creation endpoint accepts valid requests with proper category_id, calculates reading time correctly, and returns proper blog data. Blog retrieval and listing APIs also functional. 4) AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION: ✅ WORKING - Role-based access control functioning correctly. Admin users can access admin-only endpoints, unauthorized requests properly blocked with 401 status. 5) ROLE PERMISSIONS: Confirmed that category creation requires superadmin role (not regular admin), which is correct behavior. Superadmin login (superadmin@marketmindai.com/superadmin123) works and can create categories. 6) BLOG VALIDATION: Proper validation working - missing category_id returns 422 with clear error message.
